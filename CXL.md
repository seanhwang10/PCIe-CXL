# CXL Architecture & Protocol Layers

CXL’s architecture builds on the PCIe interface but introduces additional protocols that support memory coherency and cache management. It is divided into three primary protocol layers, each with its own role.

## Physical and Electrical Interface

- **PCIe Foundation**: CXL uses the same physical and electrical interface as PCIe. This means that devices can share the same form factors and connectors while using different logical protocols for enhanced functionality.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Since CXL resides atop the PCIe physical layer, systems that support PCIe can often accommodate CXL devices with appropriate firmware and software support.

## Three Protocol Layers

### CXL.io

- **Role**: Functions similarly to traditional PCIe I/O.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - **Configuration & Management**: Device enumeration, configuration space access, and error reporting.
  - **Non-Coherent Data Transfer**: Used for control and legacy I/O transactions.
- **Routing**: Uses PCIe packet routing mechanisms and is fully compatible with existing PCIe software stacks.

### CXL.cache

- **Role**: Provides a mechanism for cache-coherent memory access.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - **Caching Requests**: Allows a device (such as an accelerator) to cache host memory, reducing latency for repeated accesses.
  - **Coherency Protocols**: Maintains coherence between the host CPU caches and the device caches.
- **Usage**: Critical in workloads where rapid, coherent data access is required, such as in machine learning inference and data analytics.

### CXL.memory

- **Role**: Enables direct memory access between the host and the attached device.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - **Memory Expansion**: Allows the host to expand its addressable memory space using external memory resources attached via CXL.
  - **Low Latency Access**: Facilitates fast, byte-addressable access to device memory, which can be used as a cache extension or a standalone memory pool.
- **Mechanism**: Operates in a coherent mode, ensuring that any changes in memory state are properly synchronized between the host and the device.

# CXL Device Types and Roles

CXL supports multiple device roles within a system, each optimized for specific tasks.

## CXL Accelerator

- **Description**: Devices like GPUs, FPGAs, or AI inference engines that perform heavy computations.
- **Role in CXL**:
  - May use both the CXL.cache and CXL.memory protocols to reduce data movement latency.
  - Can directly access host memory, bypassing traditional I/O bottlenecks.

## CXL Memory Expander

- **Description**: Modules that provide additional system memory.
- **Role in CXL**:
  - Act as memory pools that can be shared across multiple processors.
  - Enable memory disaggregation, allowing for flexible scaling of memory resources in a data center.

## CXL Switch

- **Description**: Devices that facilitate the connection of multiple CXL endpoints.
- **Role in CXL**:
  - Similar to PCIe switches, they route packets among various CXL devices.
  - Essential for building scalable, multi-device fabrics that can support a diverse set of accelerators and memory modules.

# Memory Coherency and Sharing

One of the key differentiators of CXL is its support for memory coherency between the host CPU and attached devices.

## Cache Coherency

- **Maintaining Consistency**: CXL.cache ensures that when an accelerator caches data, any updates are visible to the CPU (and vice versa) without explicit data copying.
- **Protocol Interaction**: Utilizes coherency protocols that manage cache invalidations and updates, similar to how multi-core processors maintain consistency between L1/L2 caches.

## Addressing and Memory Access

- **Unified Address Space**: With CXL.memory, devices can share a common address space, allowing the host to access device memory as if it were an extension of system DRAM.
- **Low Latency Transactions**: Direct memory accesses over CXL are optimized for minimal latency, critical for high-performance applications.

---

# CXL Transaction Flow

CXL transactions are structured in a way that extends the PCIe transaction model by integrating coherency and memory semantics.

## Request and Completion Model

- **Split Transactions**: Similar to PCIe, CXL operations are divided into request and completion phases.
- **Additional Overheads**: Coherent transactions may include extra signaling to maintain cache coherency and memory consistency.
- **Protocol Interplay**: Transactions on the CXL.cache and CXL.memory layers are tightly coupled with the CXL.io layer for management and error reporting.

## Interaction with PCIe Tunneling

- **Leveraging PCIe**: CXL transactions are “tunneled” over the PCIe physical layer. This allows existing PCIe routing, flow control, and error correction mechanisms to be reused.
- **Packet Formats**: While the physical signaling is identical to PCIe, the payloads for CXL.cache and CXL.memory carry additional metadata to support coherence and memory sharing.

---

# Configuration, Enumeration, and Compatibility

## CXL Enumeration

- **Device Discovery**: Much like PCIe, the host system performs enumeration of CXL devices. The process is extended to recognize additional capabilities (e.g., memory expansion, coherent caching).
- **Configuration Space**: CXL devices often present a dual-natured configuration space—one part for legacy PCIe I/O (via CXL.io) and another for CXL-specific registers controlling memory and cache operations.

## Interoperability with PCIe

- **Physical Layer Compatibility**: Because CXL shares the PCIe physical layer, existing hardware infrastructure (slots, connectors, cabling) can be reused.
- **Software Integration**: Operating systems and drivers can leverage existing PCIe frameworks while incorporating additional support for CXL protocols.
- **Coexistence**: Systems can run a mix of traditional PCIe and CXL devices, allowing gradual migration to a more coherent and disaggregated system architecture.

# Use Cases and Future Trends

- **Accelerated Computing**: CXL enables tight coupling between CPUs and specialized accelerators, reducing data movement overhead and enabling faster processing for AI/ML workloads.
- **Memory Disaggregation**: By pooling memory resources across multiple servers, data centers can dynamically allocate memory where it’s needed most.
- **System Scalability**: CXL’s coherent interconnect allows for flexible system architectures where compute and memory resources are decoupled, leading to improved scalability and efficiency.
- **Emerging Applications**: As workloads continue to grow in complexity, CXL is expected to play a pivotal role in next-generation high-performance computing and cloud data center designs.
